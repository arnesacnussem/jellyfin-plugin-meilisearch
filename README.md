# Meilisearch Plugin for Jellyfin

This plugin is inspired by [Jellysearch](https://gitlab.com/DomiStyle/jellysearch).

Because I don't really like to use a reverse proxy, so I create this, but it still needs a Meilisearch instance to work.

For now, it just works in the search page and only search for the `/Items` endpoint, but still improves a lot.
